# Tesseract OCR with Streamlit

This project demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract and Streamlit. It allows users to upload an image, extract text from the whole image, or define custom regions of interest (ROIs) for targeted text extraction.

## Features

- Upload an image in common formats (jpg, jpeg, png).
- Extract text from the entire image using Tesseract OCR.
- Define custom ROIs to extract specific text from different regions of the image.
- Visualize the preprocessing steps, including grayscale conversion and thresholding.
- Display extracted text and visualize the corresponding ROIs on the image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- pytesseract
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
  

Install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit opencv-python pytesseract numpy pandas matplotlib


## Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/elsayedelmandoh/national_id_card_recognition.git
  cd your-repository


## Run the Streamlit app:
  streamlit run main.py

Open the provided URL in your web browser.

Upload an image and choose the extraction option.

Follow on-screen instructions to extract text from the whole image or define custom ROIs.
